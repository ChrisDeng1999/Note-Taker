## Description

This is my Note Taker Application that allows users to write down any notes they have and to save it so they have a record of it and they can refer to it at any time. Once a note is saved it stores each note by it's title and if you click on the notes on the left hand side you may see the Title of the note as well as the text for that specific note.

Below is a screenshot of what the homepage of my application looks like.
